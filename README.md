# Grid-Ponse

Grid-Ponse is a lightweight and responsive CSS framework that leverages CSS Grid to create flexible and efficient grid layouts for web pages. The primary goal of Grid-Ponse is to simplify the process of designing and developing responsive grid systems while optimizing performance.

## Features

- Easy-to-use CSS classes for creating grid layouts.
- Built on CSS Grid, a powerful layout system that offers greater control over grid-based designs.
- Responsive design support for creating fluid grid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Lightweight and minimal CSS codebase to ensure fast page loading times.
- Modular approach with customizable classes for maximum flexibility.
- Cross-browser compatibility to support a wide range of modern browsers.

## Installation

To use Grid-Ponse in your project, you can include the CSS file directly in your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/grid-ponse.css" />
```

Alternatively, you can download the CSS file and host it locally.

## Usage

Grid-Ponse provides a set of intuitive CSS classes that can be applied to HTML elements to create grid layouts. Here are some examples:

### Basic Grid Layout

To create a basic grid layout with equal-width columns, you can use the `grid` class:

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div>Column 1</div>
  <div>Column 2</div>
  <div>Column 3</div>
</div>
```

This will create a grid with three columns of equal width.

### Responsive Grid Layout

Grid-Ponse also supports responsive grid layouts. You can specify the number of columns for different screen sizes using the `grid-{breakpoint}-{columns}` class:

```html
<div class="grid grid-md-2 grid-lg-3">
  <div>Column 1</div>
  <div>Column 2</div>
  <div>Column 3</div>
</div>
```

In this example, the grid will have 2 columns on medium-sized screens and 3 columns on large screens.

### Customizing Grid Gaps

By default, Grid-Ponse applies a small gap between grid items. You can customize the gap size using the `grid-gap-{size}` class:

```html
<div class="grid grid-gap-10">
  <div>Column 1</div>
  <div>Column 2</div>
  <div>Column 3</div>
</div>
```

This will set the gap between grid items to 10 pixels.
